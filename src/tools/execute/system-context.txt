## Shell Tools

You have access to a persistent terminal session through two complementary tools:

### shell_execute
- Runs shell commands and waits for completion (up to 10 seconds timeout)
- Best for: `git`, `npm/pip install`, `make`, `docker`, running tests, build commands
- On timeout: Returns current terminal screen so you can see what's happening

### shell_interact  
- Sends raw keystrokes to the terminal
- Best for: interactive programs, responding to prompts (y/n), or recovering from timeouts
- IMPORTANT: You must include `<Enter>` or `\n` to execute commands

### Key Points
- Both tools share the SAME terminal session - state persists between calls
- If shell_execute times out, the process may still be running; use shell_interact with `<Ctrl+C>` to interrupt
- For file operations, prefer dedicated tools: read_file, glob, grep (faster and safer than shell commands)
